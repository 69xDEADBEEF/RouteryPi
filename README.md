# RouteryPi

## Summary

The RouteryPi is a WiFi access point based on a Raspberry Pi Zero W. Together with a pretty case and some status LEDs it makes a really nice alternative AP that can easily be programmed and customized. The only downside of using a Raspberry Pi is it's relative slow networking speed compared to high quality retail APs - nevertheless it has great potential and makes an even better addition if you want to upgrade some random old AP that you found in your basement!

## Hardware

You will need the following parts for this project:
- A neat looking case maybe with holes for status lights. Reusing an old router case would be ideal here (yay, upcycling!).
- A Raspberry Pi Zero W - the mainboard.
- An OTG Ethernet Adapter (USB 2.0).
- A MicroSD card (anything class 6 and higher will do really).
- A good power supply and connector (1A is plenty of power).
- Some wire to connect everything.

Optional:
- Some LEDs and resistors if you want status LEDs.
- A push button to reset the Pi.
- On/Off switch (to kill the power obviously).
- A heatsink - you don't need it but your Pi will thank you.
